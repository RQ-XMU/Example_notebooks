    "For clarification, let us understand Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic in layman terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neural Networks** are very good in generalization and learning a **mapping** from **input** set of values (features) **to an output** value. <br> Take it as a **black box**, you **provide** it a **training set** containing multiple rows of $input_i \\Rightarrow output_i$, and the **box formulates a general rule** with these training samples. Now, when you **provide values** for the same features as input, the **black box tells the output** according to the rules it has learnt.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fuzzy Logic** is used to **model uncertainties** as seen in many real world scenarios. It is a **superset of boolean logic** which has strict boundries between different classes. <br> Consider the following statement. <br> \" If the **speed** of car is **slow** then **do A**, if the speed is **medium** then **do B** or if the speed is **fast** then **do C** \" where A, B and C could be actions/tasks, that can be represented by some mathematical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, note that the terms **slow**, **medium** and **fast** are **not very well defined**, and are **fuzzy** terms. There is **no strict boundaries** described on speed value but still the terms give an idea for likely values they could be. <br> Such systems are modelled by fuzzy logic, where **membership functions** are defined to represent the extent to which the value can be said to fall in a particular class. e.g. for the above mentioned statements, the speed to class can be modelled by following membership functions ($\\mu_{slow}, \\mu_{medium}$ and $\\mu_{fast}$):<br> ![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4cce98c6bdb70452db246828251085fe-c) <br> Values less than 35 MPH are considered **slow**. But value 40 MPH will lie in two classes **slow** as well as **medium**. Take it as $\\mu_{slow}(40)=0.75, \\mu_{medium}(40)=0.25$ and $\\mu_{fast}(40)=0$. (The sum is not always required to be 1 in fuzzy modelling. Here it is but you may define the membership function as per your model understanding). **Now coming to the part how these two are combined?**"

    "### Uncertain or Imprecise Information \n",
    "**Precise numerical information** from sensors is critically important for correct functioning of technical systems. On the other hand, **not all process variables can be quantified**. For these nonmeasurable or categorical variables (e.g., food taste or flavor), it is important to distinguish three different types of **imprecision**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical imprecision**: Variables with statistical imprecision represent the **probability of random occurrence** and have a value in the range from 0 to 1. The probability theory and statistics are powerful instruments to process this kind of information. In statistics, **precision is the reciprocal of the variance**, and the precision matrix (also known as concentration matrix) is the matrix inverse of the covariance matrix. Statistical imprecision can **be minimized by using Bayesian analysis**, in particular *likelihood function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informal imprecision**: This kind of imprecision comes **from deficiency** of information or knowledge, which is often difficult or impossible to obtain. This imprecision can be related to product/process variability due to uncertain initial conditions (product physicochemical properties, etc.) or unpredictable process disturbances (relative humidity, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linguistic imprecision**: This type occurs because of imprecise or vague information in **human communication**, which usually operates with linguistic variables, such as **good, normal, bad, awful**, and so on. The interpretation of this **information depends on context, personal preferences**, and so on. Fuzzy logic deals with this kind of imprecision, using a set of rules to achieve a desired goal (rule-based approach).\n",

    "## ANFIS IN DRYING\n",
    "[Home](#toc)<br>\n",
    "Fuzzy logic and artiicial neural networks (ANNs) are complementary technologies in the design of intelligent systems. The integration of these techniques in the form of ANFIS appears to be a promising tool for modeling, control, and optimization of complex systems with signiicant uncertainty (Azar, 2010). The integrated system has the advantages of both neural network (i.e., learning and computational capabilities) and fuzzy systems (reasoning, rule-based decision making). The beneits of ANFIS are summarized by Takagi and Hayashi (1991) into the following four cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NN‚Äôs being used to automate the task of designing and ine-tuning the membership functions of fuzzy systems\n",
    "- Both fuzzy inference and NNs provide separate learning capabilities\n",
    "- NN‚Äôs work as correcting mechanisms for fuzzy systems\n",
    "-  NN‚Äôs being used to customize the standard system according each user‚Äôs preferences and individual needs\n",
    "\n",
    "ANFIS is a fuzzy reasoning system with parameters trained by NN-based algorithms. The simpliied structure of ANFIS with two inputs and one output is shown in Figure 8.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANFIS architecture usually includes ive layers: (1) **fuzziication layer**; (2) **rule operation layer**; (3) **normalization layer**; (4) **consequent layer**; and (5) **aggregation** layer. The irst three layers are organized as a neural networks, which allows self-organization of fuzzy rules. ANFIS learning capability is based on the Takagi-Sugeno approach, where output is a parametrical function of input variables. In the last decade ANFIS became especially popular in drying applications, mostly due to a developed package in MATLAB software. The summary of ANFIS applications in drying is presented in Table 8.3.\n",

    "## Advantages Using ANFIS\n",
    "[Home](#toc)\n",
    "1. ANFIS has the ability to **handle large amounts of noisy or ill-behaved data** from nonlinear or complex dynamic systems.\n",
    "2. ANFIS is especially **useful in modeling** system with **unknown** or **not fully understood underlying physical relationships** between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "3. ANFIS can **integrate information from several sources** such as expert systems, human reasoning (heuristics), empirical models and data for **effective model development**.\n",
    "4. ANFIS is capable of **reducing the dimensionality** of the problem by using a subtractive clustering technique which prevents the combinatorial explosion of fuzzy rules when input data sets involve higher dimensions. **Subtractive clustering** methods are especially useful for building the fuzzy model when no prior knowledge of the fuzzy rules exists. The cluster produced is then utilized to produce the initial Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system that best models the behavior of the given data. Backpropagation in ANFIS can be used after that to tune the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages Using ANFIS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since ANFIS is a **data-driven modeling technique**, it is extremely important to select the appropriate input variables which provide the essential information needed for successful modeling. In other words, it is important to **avoid losing key information** when omitting one or more key input variables and to prevent the inclusion of redundant or irrelevant input variables that can confuse the training process. While this applies to any modeling technique, it is more crucial in ANFIS as it **depends heavily on input‚Äìoutput** data for modeling compared to other methods.\n",
    "2. The **number of fuzzy rules** increases **exponentially** with the increase in the **number of input** variables as given by the formula: $p^n$ where $p$ is the number of fuzzy membership functions and n is the number of input variables. This means a high number of membership functions and/or input variables will yield an excessively high number of fuzzy rules, **making ANFIS too difficult to apply for new unseen data and increasing the computational time significantly**. Prior experience and knowledge of the user and the use of a clustering tool for input variables may help reducing this problem.\n",
    "3. The **successful implementation of ANFIS requires** the availability of a relatively **large data set** for training and cross-validation. In several cases, however, it may be difficult to generate adequate amount of data for various reasons such as cost, difficulty in measurements or simply unavailability. Adequate data sets are needed to prevent model under-fitting (a model with poor generalization capability for unseen data).\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Guidelines for Using ANFIS\n",
    "There are general guidelines that can be followed for successful development of ANFIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Selecting appropriate input variables* selecting adequate input variables is important to **avoid model under-fitting**. In other words, to avoid missing important information about the system is being modeled. This is considered an important primary task. Inclusion of irrelevant or highly correlated input variables may degrade the reliability of model training and validation process. On the other hand, model over-fitting which occurs when too many input variables are used to build the model can adversely affect the usefulness and generalization capabilities of the model. In ANFIS, this depends on the experience and knowledge of the user in a specific process. In addition, some tools such as subtractive culturing, by combining the highly related (correlated) input variables to one or more clusters and therefore reducing the dimensionality of the input variables, can improve the reliability of the model developed and reduce the computational burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Choosing appropriate number and type of membership functions prior* **experience and knowledge** of the user can help choosing the appropriate type and number of membership functions in addition to data partition scheme (splitting the data for training and validation) and selecting the best type of optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *The successful implementation of ANFIS* this requires a **relatively large data set for training and validation** which is sometimes needed to prevent model under-fitting and to yield a good generalization of the results for unseen data. A general guideline would be to increase the size of data set as the number of model inputs is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use ANFIS?\n",
    "ANFIS is a hybrid intelligent modeling technique with\n",
    "outstanding modeling capabilities which can be applied in\n",
    "several areas of food industry. Nevertheless, it would be\n",
    "inefficient it in applications where analytical modeling or\n",
    "other more straightforward statistical modeling techniques\n",
    "are applicable and adequate. Some applications where the\n",
    "application of ANFIS is recommended include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problems which involve **fuzzy or blurred attributes** such as in descriptive sensory testing.\n",
    "- Problems that involve **complex or ill-conditioned systems** such as multivariable, time-varying processes or **highly complex functional relationships** such as such as intermittent drying.\n",
    "- Problems that involve **noisy data** from dynamic or nonlinear systems such as **time series** forecasting.\n",
    "- Problems which involve **physical relationships** that may **not** be **fully understood** or **difficult to predict** accurately such as modeling microbial growth."
